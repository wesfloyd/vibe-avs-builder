# Document View Rendering and Triggering

The document view in this project is primarily managed by the following components:

- [`components/document-preview.tsx`](mdc:components/document-preview.tsx): Main entry point for rendering a document preview, including header, content, and interaction logic.
- [`components/document.tsx`](mdc:components/document.tsx): Contains UI for document tool results and calls, and handles user interactions to open documents.
- [`components/artifact.tsx`](mdc:components/artifact.tsx): Manages the state and logic for document artifacts, including versioning, editing, and visibility.

## How the Document View is Triggered
- The document view is shown when a user creates, updates, or clicks on a document reference in the chat interface.
- The `setArtifact` function from [`hooks/use-artifact.ts`](mdc:hooks/use-artifact.ts) is used to update the current document artifact state, which causes the document view to render.
- The document preview is also invoked when a document is selected from a list of artifacts or as a result of an AI assistant action.
