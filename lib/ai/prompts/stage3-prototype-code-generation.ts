# ** BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM **


Generate a high level task list of the changes to be made to the hello-world-avs codebase to implement the user's AVS idea or design. You can implement any changes as needed to the entire hello-world-avs codebase. The full hello-world-avs codebase is provided later in this prompt.  

The following components are recommended to be modified at a minimum:
- ServiceManager contract and deployment code.
- Operator code and add Operator code files as needed for execution or validation.
- README.md file including project overview, installation instructions, and how to run the operator binaries.

Format for your response should include a simple bulleted list using asterisks single depth (not nested) of the changes to be made to the codebase. 
Do Not use backticks in the response for any reason. Backticks are not allowed.

Do not use a numbered list.
Do not use a nested list.

Do not include changes for Slashing or Rewards payments.
Use italics instead of backticks for filenames in your response. 

At the end of your response, ask the user if they would like to proceed with the code generation.

export const stage3PrototypePromptDetailedCodeGeneration = `
# ** BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM **

Your Primary task:  your job is to generate the entire modified hello-world-avs codebase in Typescript based on the supplied task list.

Ask the user for clarification if the task list is ambiguous or incomplete, rather than guessing.

Recreate all the files in the existing hello-world-avs codebase shown below and also generate the modifications or new files needed to implement the user's supplied design or task list.

Each file must have a "path", "summary", and "content" field.

Each generated code file must be included as a child element inside a JSON array similar to the following example:
[
    {
        "path": "..",
        "summary": "..",
        "content": ".."
    },
    {
        "path": "..",
        "summary": "..",
        "content": ".."
    },
    {
        "path": "..",
        "summary": "..",
        "content": ".."
    }
]

"Path" should be relative to the root of the hello-world-avs codebase.
The output must be a single JSON array, not multiple arrays or objects.

Remove any trailing commas after the last property in each object or array in your JSON file.

Check to ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.
Only respond with the JSON objects, no other text or comments.
No extra text, explanations, or markdown should be includedâ€”just the raw JSON array.

# Instructions for llm:

Dear LLM - use the following prompts to guide you in implementing the the prototype Autonomous Verifiable Service (AVS) on EigenLayer.

Your Primary task:  your job is to to first determine a confidence on how likely the user's AVS idea can be implemented with EigenLayer hello-world-avs code.

If you are less than 50% confident that the user's AVS idea can be implemented with EigenLayer hello-world-avs code, then respond with a message to the user explaining that you are not confident that the idea can be implemented with EigenLayer hello-world-avs code, include your confidence score and give specific reasons why.

If you are more than 50% confident that the user's AVS idea can be implemented with EigenLayer hello-world-avs code, then proceed with the following steps.

## Last Step:Generate Code
Generate only the code for hello-world-avs needed to implement the user's AVS idea or design.
Important: each file generated should be returned as child elements in a JSON object. Each child element should have the following format:
{
  "fileName": "filename.ts",
  "fileContent": "file content"
}

Do not generate your own Recommendations, Limitations or Next Steps.

The full codebase for hello-world-avs will be provided next in these instructions.


### 1. ServiceManager Smart Contracts

contracts/HelloWorldServiceManager.sol and contracts/IHelloWorldServiceManager.sol.
  - Modify the primary AVS Service Manager contract to fit the logic of the new AVS. 
  - Rename the contract to match the name of the user's AVS idea or design.
  - Include the logic to track registered operators, assign tasks if necessary, and verify results.
  - If needed: define relevant data structures, events, and helper functions.  
  - If needed: add modifiers/functions that implement your custom validation approach. 
  - Do not generate code for Slashing.

### 2. Operator Typescript Code

All Operator code should be written in TypeScript.
- Use the  folder. 
- Modify the /operator/index.ts file to represent the offchain Operator logic.
- Include any necessary libraries or frameworks for your computation.
- Operator Workflow:  
  1. Initialization: Connect to the smart contract and register.  
  2. Task Subscription: Subscribe to events (e.g., new tasks available).  
  3. Compute: Perform the required computation or verification.  
  4. Result Submission: Post results on-chain (or via a designated off-chain aggregator that eventually writes on-chain).  
- You may also create additional files to represent the Verification logic.

### 3. README

Modify the README.md file at the root of your repository to include:
1. Project Overview: Brief explanation of what the AVS does.  
2. Installation Instructions: Prerequisites, environment variables, and libraries.  
3. How to Run the Operator Binaries:  
   - Steps to compile or install any dependencies.  
   - How to start the binary and configure it.
