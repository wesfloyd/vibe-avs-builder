# Manual Test Snippets

## Stage 1 Idea Tests

### Positive Test
I want help refining my AVS idea. My ideas is for an AVS that generates cat images, then have a group of operators verify whether the likelihood of that operator being a cat image greater than 90%


### Negative Test

build an avs that generates cat images

## Stage 2 Design Tech Spec Generation Tests

Help me generate a design tech spec for my AVS using this idea for guidance

CatLLM: AI Cat Image Generation and Validation AVS
1. Project Overview
CatLLM is a decentralized AI cat image generation platform that produces high-quality, unique cat images for users. It leverages the security and decentralization of EigenLayer to ensure reliable image generation and quality assurance.

2. AVS Purpose
This AVS provides a decentralized approach to AI image generation by distributing both the creation and validation of images across multiple operators. This increases reliability, prevents centralized censorship, and ensures consistent quality through a decentralized validation mechanism.

3. Name
CatLLM (Cat Large Language Model) Validator

4. Operator Work
The AVS consists of two types of operators:

Generator Operator: A single operator that generates cat images using LLM inference
Validator Operators: Multiple operators that evaluate the quality and accuracy of the generated cat images using their own LLMs
5. Validation
The work is validated through a decentralized accuracy assessment system where at least two validator operators independently evaluate each generated cat image. Each validator assigns an accuracy rating between 0% and 100% based on criteria such as:

Image quality
Recognizability as a cat
Adherence to any specified attributes or characteristics
Uniqueness compared to previously generated images
These independent validations create a consensus mechanism that prevents any single validator from having undue influence over the acceptance or rejection of generated images.

6. Rewards
Reward distributions to Operators are based on the following criteria:

Validator operators receive rewards for each completed validation, regardless of the score they assign
The generator operator receives rewards when the average validator accuracy rating exceeds 90%, incentivizing high-quality image generation
This reward structure ensures both thorough validation and high-quality image generation
This model incentivizes honest validation (since validators are always rewarded for participation) while also motivating the generator to produce high-quality cat images (since they only receive rewards for exceptional work above the 90% threshold).
